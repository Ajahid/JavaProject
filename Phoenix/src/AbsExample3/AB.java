//	It will remain the same in any implemented classes. 
	
	
//	We use abstract class we we want to do standardization 
//  We can also use abstract method we we don't know the implementation of the method
//	We can have both abstract and non abstract code in abstract class
	
	
//	Abstract Class / Interface
	
//	We can only extend abstract class once
